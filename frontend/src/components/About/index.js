            Hello, we are the Uni-Events team consisting of 1 team member, Nick Sim.
            We wanted to deliver a way for University students to see events going on
            around them. Unfortunately this site is optimized for users for now and
            not for event creators- coming soon!
            <br></br>
            Thanks for looking!
